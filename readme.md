## How to start working

_This will be a script at some point. In the future._

1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)
2. `cd src/themes`
3. `git clone https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn.git`

Profit!

## How to change things and deploy

_This will also be a script at some point. In a closer future._

The editable files are in `src`. The files at the same level of this readme are automatically generated. Refer to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) docs if you have doubts.

To run the development server do `cd src && hugo server`.

To deploy:

1. `cd src`
2. `hugo`
3. Comit all the changes, including the automatically generated.
4. `git push` to master.
